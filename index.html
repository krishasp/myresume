        <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
        <p>I’m deeply passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, leveraging data-driven insights to design smarter, more adaptive digital solutions. Backed by a certification in Data Science and Machine Learning, I enjoy exploring how intelligent systems can enhance the way users interact with technology and make everyday experiences more intuitive.Alongside my AI and ML focus, I have a keen interest in web design and development, which I’ve cultivated through self-taught learning and hands-on practice. This allows me to combine creativity and technical skill to craft visually engaging, user-centric digital experiences. My background in digital marketing and user-focused strategy further strengthens my ability to build products that are not only functional but also impactful and aligned with real-world user needs.
        Driven by curiosity and a creative mindset, I strive to merge intelligent technology with thoughtful design, transforming innovative ideas into meaningful, data-powered experiences.
